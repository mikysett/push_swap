Sorting with two stacks and basic operations (`swap`, `push`, `rotate`, `reverse rotate`).

## Content
- `push_swap` program *(not ready yet!)*
- `Checker` (to check if the instructions of push_swap gives a sorted stack as result)
- `speed_tester` to compare different push_swaps implementations (see the readme there for more details)
